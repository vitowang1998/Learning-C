// pass by value
// In C, when we pass a parameter to a function, a copy of the very parameter is made and passed.
// This way is called "pass by value"
// This implies that when we pass a complicated struct to a function, a copy of the entire struct will be made, which may lead to a waste of stack memory.




// Pass by reference: pass a variable to a function and the variable can be mutated by the function.

#include <stdio.h>
