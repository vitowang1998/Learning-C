// Heap

// Heap is part of memory.
// We can borrow some part of heap through "allocation" and free the borrowed part
//      through "deallocation".

// Heap is much bigger than stack, however, it still has a finite size.
// When we try to borrow more memory than the heap can offer, the program will crash.
